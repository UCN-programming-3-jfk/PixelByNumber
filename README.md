# PixelByNumber

An app implementation of the monochrome image format found in the [Classic CS Unplugged exercise "Image representation"](https://classic.csunplugged.org/activities/image-representation)
The app lets you either paint using the mouse or write the pixel format in a text box and will realtime convert back and forth.
